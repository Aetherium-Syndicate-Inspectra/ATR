# ATR Core Server (Class D)

**ATR (Aetherium Transmission & Retrieval)** is a Class D Deep Core Server 
serving as the Ground Truth Authority of the AETHERIUM GENESIS ecosystem.

It is not an application server.
It is not a runtime.
It is not an orchestrator.

ATR is a structural sovereign layer that enforces truth.

## 🧠 Architectural Classification

**Class D – Deep Core**

ATR acts as:

- Nervous System (Transport Layer)
- Immune System (Validation & Enforcement)
- State Authority (E3 Hybrid Truth Model)

It does not "think".
It **knows** and **enforces**.
